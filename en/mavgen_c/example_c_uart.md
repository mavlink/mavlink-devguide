# MAVLink C UART Interface Example

The [C-UART Interface Example](https://github.com/mavlink/c_uart_interface_example) is a simple C example of a MAVLink to UART interface for Unix-like systems.

The example source code demonstrates how to set up serial communication between Pixhawk and an offboard computer via USB or a telemetry radio,
how to put the vehicle in offboard mode, and how to send and receive MAVLink messages over the interface.

Source code and instructions for how to run the example can be found in the Github repo: [mavlink/c_uart_interface_example](https://github.com/mavlink/c_uart_interface_example)
