# MAVLink Developer Guide

MAVLink is a very lightweight messaging protocol for communicating with drones (and between onboard drone components).

MAVLink follows a modern hybrid publish-subscribe and point-to-point design pattern: Data streams are sent / published as **topics** while configuration sub-protocols such as the [mission protocol](services/mission.md) or [parameter protocol](services/parameter.md) are point-to-point with retransmission.

Messages are [defined within XML files](messages/README.md).
Each XML file defines the message set supported by a particular MAVLink system, also referred to as a "dialect". 
The reference message set that is implemented by *most* ground control stations and autopilots is defined in [common.xml](messages/common.md) (most dialects *build on top of* this definition).

[Code generators](getting_started/generate_libraries.md) create software libraries for [specific programming languages](#supported_languages) from these XML message definitions, which can then be used by drones, ground control stations, and other MAVLink systems to communicate.
The generated libraries are typically MIT-licensed, and can therefore be *used* without limits in any closed-source application without publishing the source code of the closed-source application.

> **Note** The C reference implementation is a header-only library that is highly optimized for resource-constrained systems with limited RAM and flash memory. 
  It is field-proven and deployed in many products where it serves as interoperability interface between components of different manufacturers.

MAVLink was first released early 2009 by Lorenz Meier and has now a [significant number of contributors](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/graphs/contributors).


## Key Features

- Very efficient. MAVLink 1 has just 8 bytes overhead per packet, including start sign and packet drop detection. MAVLink 2 has just 14 bytes of overhead (but is a much more secure and extensible protocol).
  Because MAVLink doesn't require any additional framing it is very well suited for applications with very limited communication bandwidth.
- Very reliable. MAVLink has been used since 2009 to communicate between many different vehicles, ground stations (and other nodes) over varied and challenging communication channels (high latency/noise). It provides methods for detecting packet drops, corruption, and for packet authentication.
- [Many different programming languages](#supported_languages) can be used, running on numerous microcontrollers/operating systems (including ARM7, ATMega, dsPic, STM32 and Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and iOS).
- Allows up to 255 concurrent systems on the network (vehicles, ground stations, etc.)
- Enables both offboard and onboard communications (e.g. between a GCS and drone, and between drone autopilot and MAVLink enabled drone camera).
