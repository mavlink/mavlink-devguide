# MAVLINK Common Message Set (common.xml)

The MAVLink *common* message set contains *standard* definitions that are managed by the MAVLink project.
The definitions cover functionality that is considered useful to most ground control stations and autopilots.
MAVLink-compatible systems are expected to use these definitions where possible (if an appropriate message exists) rather than rolling out variants in their own [dialects](../messages/README.md).

The original definitions are defined in [common.xml](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/blob/master/message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml).


<span id="mav2_extension_field"></span>

## Messages

### HEARTBEAT (0) — \[from: [minimal](../messages/minimal.md#HEARTBEAT)\] {#HEARTBEAT}

### SYS_STATUS (1) {#SYS_STATUS}

The general system state. If the system is following the MAVLink standard, the system state is mainly defined by three orthogonal states/modes: The system mode, which is either LOCKED (motors shut down and locked), MANUAL (system under RC control), GUIDED (system with autonomous position control, position setpoint controlled manually) or AUTO (system guided by path/waypoint planner). The [NAV_MODE](#NAV_MODE) defined the current flight state: LIFTOFF (often an open-loop maneuver), LANDING, WAYPOINTS or VECTOR. This represents the internal navigation state machine. The system status shows whether the system is currently active or not and if an emergency occurred. During the CRITICAL and EMERGENCY states the MAV is still considered to be active, but should start emergency procedures autonomously. After a failure occurred it should first move from active to critical to allow manual intervention and then move to emergency after a certain timeout.

### PARAM_REQUEST_READ (20) {#PARAM_REQUEST_READ}

Request to read the onboard parameter with the param_id string id. Onboard parameters are stored as key[const char*] -> value[float]. This allows to send a parameter to any other component (such as the GCS) without the need of previous knowledge of possible parameter names. Thus the same GCS can store different parameters for different autopilots. See also https://mavlink.io/en/services/parameter.html for a full documentation of QGroundControl and IMU code.

--- | --- | ---
target_system | `uint8_t` | System ID 
target_component | `uint8_t` | Component ID 
param_id | `char[16]` | Onboard parameter id, terminated by NULL if the length is less than 16 human-readable chars and WITHOUT null termination (NULL) byte if the length is exactly 16 chars - applications have to provide 16+1 bytes storage if the ID is stored as string

### PARAM_SET (23) {#PARAM_SET}

Set a parameter value (write new value to permanent storage).

The receiving component should acknowledge the new parameter value by broadcasting a [PARAM_VALUE](#PARAM_VALUE) message (broadcasting ensures that multiple GCS all have an up-to-date list of all parameters). If the sending GCS did not receive a [PARAM_VALUE](#PARAM_VALUE) within its timeout time, it should re-send the [PARAM_SET](#PARAM_SET) message. The parameter microservice is documented at https://mavlink.io/en/services/parameter.html.
[PARAM_SET](#PARAM_SET) may also be called within the context of a transaction (started with [MAV_CMD_PARAM_TRANSACTION](#MAV_CMD_PARAM_TRANSACTION)). Within a transaction the receiving component should respond with [PARAM_ACK_TRANSACTION](#PARAM_ACK_TRANSACTION) to the setter component (instead of broadcasting [PARAM_VALUE](#PARAM_VALUE)), and [PARAM_SET](#PARAM_SET) should be re-sent if this is ACK not received.

--- | --- | --- | ---
target_system | `uint8_t` | | System ID 
target_component | `uint8_t` | | Component ID 
param_id | `char[16]` | | Onboard parameter id, terminated by NULL if the length is less than 16 human-readable chars and WITHOUT null termination (NULL) byte if the length is exactly 16 chars - applications have to provide 16+1 bytes storage if the ID is stored as string

### TIMESYNC (111) {#TIMESYNC}

Time synchronization message.
The message is used for both timesync requests and responses.
The request is sent with `ts1=syncing component timestamp` and `tc1=0`, and may be broadcast or targeted to a specific system/component.
The response is sent with `ts1=syncing component timestamp` (mirror back unchanged), and `tc1=responding component timestamp`, with the `target_system` and `target_component` set to ids of the original request.
Systems can determine if they are receiving a request or response based on the value of `tc`.
If the response has `target_system==target_component==0` the remote system has not been updated to use the component IDs and cannot reliably timesync; the requestor may report an error.
Timestamps are UNIX Epoch time or time since system boot in nanoseconds (the timestamp format can be inferred by checking for the magnitude of the number; generally it doesn't matter as only the offset is used).
The message sequence is repeated numerous times with results being filtered/averaged to estimate the offset.

altitude_terrain | `float` | m | This is the altitude above terrain. It might be fed by a terrain database or an altimeter. Values smaller than -1000 should be interpreted as unknown. 
bottom_clearance | `float` | m | This is not the altitude, but the clear space below the system according to the fused clearance estimate. It generally should max out at the maximum range of e.g. the laser altimeter. It is generally a moving target. A negative value indicates no measurement available.

For the angles encoded in the quaternion and the angular velocities holds:
If the flag [GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_VEHICLE_FRAME](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_VEHICLE_FRAME) is set, then they are relative to the vehicle heading (vehicle frame).
If the flag [GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_EARTH_FRAME](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_EARTH_FRAME) is set, then they are relative to absolute North (earth frame).
If neither of these flags are set, then (for backwards compatibility) it holds:
If the flag [GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_LOCK](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_LOCK) is set, then they are relative to absolute North (earth frame),
else they are relative to the vehicle heading (vehicle frame).

For the angles encoded in the quaternion and the angular velocities holds:
If the flag [GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_VEHICLE_FRAME](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_VEHICLE_FRAME) is set, then they are relative to the vehicle heading (vehicle frame).
If the flag [GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_EARTH_FRAME](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_EARTH_FRAME) is set, then they are relative to absolute North (earth frame).
If neither of these flags are set, then (for backwards compatibility) it holds:
If the flag [GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_LOCK](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_LOCK) is set, then they are relative to absolute North (earth frame),
else they are relative to the vehicle heading (vehicle frame).
Other conditions of the flags are not allowed.
The quaternion and angular velocities in the other frame can be calculated from delta_yaw and delta_yaw_velocity as
q_earth = q_delta_yaw * q_vehicle and w_earth = w_delta_yaw_velocity + w_vehicle (if not NaN).
If neither the [GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_VEHICLE_FRAME](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_VEHICLE_FRAME) nor the [GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_EARTH_FRAME](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_EARTH_FRAME) flag is set,
then (for backwards compatibility) the data in the delta_yaw and delta_yaw_velocity fields are to be ignored.
New implementations should always set either [GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_VEHICLE_FRAME](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_VEHICLE_FRAME) or [GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_EARTH_FRAME](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_EARTH_FRAME),

### MAV_FRAME {#MAV_FRAME}

Coordinate frames used by MAVLink. Not all frames are supported by all commands, messages, or vehicles.


Global frames use the following naming conventions:
- "GLOBAL": Global coordinate frame with WGS84 latitude/longitude and altitude positive over mean sea level (MSL) by default.
The following modifiers may be used with "GLOBAL":
- "RELATIVE_ALT": Altitude is relative to the vehicle home position rather than MSL.
- "TERRAIN_ALT": Altitude is relative to ground level rather than MSL.
- "INT": Latitude/longitude (in degrees) are scaled by multiplying by 1E7.

Local frames use the following naming conventions:
- "LOCAL": Origin of local frame is fixed relative to earth. Unless otherwise specified this origin is the origin of the vehicle position-estimator ("EKF").
- "BODY": Origin of local frame travels with the vehicle. NOTE, "BODY" does NOT indicate alignment of frame axis with vehicle attitude.
- "OFFSET": Deprecated synonym for "BODY" (origin travels with the vehicle). Not to be used for new frames.

Some deprecated frames do not follow these conventions (e.g. [MAV_FRAME_BODY_NED](#MAV_FRAME_BODY_NED) and [MAV_FRAME_BODY_OFFSET_NED](#MAV_FRAME_BODY_OFFSET_NED)).

### MAV_CMD_DO_RETURN_PATH_START (188) — [WIP] {#MAV_CMD_DO_RETURN_PATH_START}

<span class="warning">**WORK IN PROGRESS**: Do not use in stable production environments (it may change).</span>

Mission item to specify the start of a failsafe/landing return-path segment (the end of the segment is the next [MAV_CMD_DO_LAND_START](#MAV_CMD_DO_LAND_START) item).

A vehicle that is using missions for landing (e.g. in a return mode) will join the mission on the closest path of the return-path segment (instead of [MAV_CMD_DO_LAND_START](#MAV_CMD_DO_LAND_START) or the nearest waypoint).
The main use case is to minimize the failsafe flight path in corridor missions, where the inbound/outbound paths are constrained (by geofences) to the same particular path.
The [MAV_CMD_NAV_RETURN_PATH_START](#MAV_CMD_NAV_RETURN_PATH_START) would be placed at the start of the return path.
If a failsafe occurs on the outbound path the vehicle will move to the nearest point on the return path (which is parallel for this kind of mission), effectively turning round and following the shortest path to landing.
If a failsafe occurs on the inbound path the vehicle is already on the return segment and will continue to landing.
The Latitude/Longitude/Altitude are optional, and may be set to 0 if not needed.
If specified, the item defines the waypoint at which the return segment starts.
If sent using as a command, the vehicle will perform a mission landing (using the land segment if defined) or reject the command if mission landings are not supported, or no mission landing is defined. When used as a command any position information in the command is ignored.

### MAV_CMD_DO_SET_MISSION_CURRENT (224) {#MAV_CMD_DO_SET_MISSION_CURRENT}

Set the mission item with sequence number seq as the current item and emit [MISSION_CURRENT](#MISSION_CURRENT) (whether or not the mission number changed).
If a mission is currently being executed, the system will continue to this new mission item on the shortest path, skipping any intermediate mission items.
Note that mission jump repeat counters are not reset unless param2 is set (see [MAV_CMD_DO_JUMP](#MAV_CMD_DO_JUMP) param2).

This command may trigger a mission state-machine change on some systems: for example from [MISSION_STATE_NOT_STARTED](#MISSION_STATE_NOT_STARTED) or [MISSION_STATE_PAUSED](#MISSION_STATE_PAUSED) to [MISSION_STATE_ACTIVE](#MISSION_STATE_ACTIVE).
If the system is in mission mode, on those systems this command might therefore start, restart or resume the mission.
If the system is not in mission mode this command must not trigger a switch to mission mode.

The mission may be "reset" using param2.
Resetting sets jump counters to initial values (to reset counters without changing the current mission item set the param1 to `-1`).
Resetting also explicitly changes a mission state of [MISSION_STATE_COMPLETE](#MISSION_STATE_COMPLETE) to [MISSION_STATE_PAUSED](#MISSION_STATE_PAUSED) or [MISSION_STATE_ACTIVE](#MISSION_STATE_ACTIVE), potentially allowing it to resume when it is (next) in a mission mode.

### MAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE (2000) {#MAV_CMD_IMAGE_START_CAPTURE}

Start image capture sequence. [CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED](#CAMERA_IMAGE_CAPTURED) must be emitted after each capture.


Param1 (id) may be used to specify the target camera: 0: all cameras, 1 to 6: autopilot-connected cameras, 7-255: MAVLink camera component ID.
It is needed in order to target specific cameras connected to the autopilot, or specific sensors in a multi-sensor camera (neither of which have a distinct MAVLink component ID).
It is also needed to specify the target camera in missions.

When used in a mission, an autopilot should execute the [MAV_CMD](#mav_commands) for a specified local camera (param1 = 1-6), or resend it as a command if it is intended for a MAVLink camera (param1 = 7 - 255), setting the command's target_component as the param1 value (and setting param1 in the command to zero).
If the param1 is 0 the autopilot should do both.

When sent in a command the target MAVLink address is set using target_component.
If addressed specifically to an autopilot: param1 should be used in the same way as it is for missions (though command should NACK with [MAV_RESULT_DENIED](#MAV_RESULT_DENIED) if a specified local camera does not exist).
If addressed to a MAVLink camera, param 1 can be used to address all cameras (0), or to separately address 1 to 7 individual sensors. Other values should be NACKed with [MAV_RESULT_DENIED](#MAV_RESULT_DENIED).
If the command is broadcast (target_component is 0) then param 1 should be set to 0 (any other value should be NACKED with [MAV_RESULT_DENIED](#MAV_RESULT_DENIED)). An autopilot would trigger any local cameras and forward the command to all channels.

### MAV_CMD_IMAGE_STOP_CAPTURE (2001) {#MAV_CMD_IMAGE_STOP_CAPTURE}

Stop image capture sequence.


Param1 (id) may be used to specify the target camera: 0: all cameras, 1 to 6: autopilot-connected cameras, 7-255: MAVLink camera component ID.
It is needed in order to target specific cameras connected to the autopilot, or specific sensors in a multi-sensor camera (neither of which have a distinct MAVLink component ID).
It is also needed to specify the target camera in missions.

When used in a mission, an autopilot should execute the [MAV_CMD](#mav_commands) for a specified local camera (param1 = 1-6), or resend it as a command if it is intended for a MAVLink camera (param1 = 7 - 255), setting the command's target_component as the param1 value (and setting param1 in the command to zero).
If the param1 is 0 the autopilot should do both.

When sent in a command the target MAVLink address is set using target_component.
If addressed specifically to an autopilot: param1 should be used in the same way as it is for missions (though command should NACK with [MAV_RESULT_DENIED](#MAV_RESULT_DENIED) if a specified local camera does not exist).
If addressed to a MAVLink camera, param1 can be used to address all cameras (0), or to separately address 1 to 7 individual sensors. Other values should be NACKed with [MAV_RESULT_DENIED](#MAV_RESULT_DENIED).
If the command is broadcast (target_component is 0) then param 1 should be set to 0 (any other value should be NACKED with [MAV_RESULT_DENIED](#MAV_RESULT_DENIED)). An autopilot would trigger any local cameras and forward the command to all channels.

### MAV_CMD_EXTERNAL_POSITION_ESTIMATE (43003) {#MAV_CMD_EXTERNAL_POSITION_ESTIMATE}

Provide an external position estimate for use when dead-reckoning. This is meant to be used for occasional position resets that may be provided by a external system such as a remote pilot using landmarks over a video link.

Param (Label) | Description | Units
--- | --- | ---
1 (transmission_time) | Timestamp that this message was sent as a time in the transmitters time domain. The sender should wrap this time back to zero based on required timing accuracy for the application and the limitations of a 32 bit float. For example, wrapping at 10 hours would give approximately 1ms accuracy. Recipient must handle time wrap in any timing jitter correction applied to this field. Wrap rollover time should not be at not more than 250 seconds, which would give approximately 10 microsecond accuracy. | s 
2 (processing_time) | The time spent in processing the sensor data that is the basis for this position. The recipient can use this to improve time alignment of the data. Set to zero if not known. | s 
3 (accuracy) | estimated one standard deviation accuracy of the measurement. Set to NaN if not known. |   
4 | Empty |   
5 (Latitude) | Latitude |   
6 (Longitude) | Longitude |   
7 (Altitude) | Altitude, not used. Should be sent as NaN. May be supported in a future version of this message. | m
