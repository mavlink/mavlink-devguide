# MAVLINK Common Message Set

The MAVLink *common* message set contains *standard* definitions that are managed by the MAVLink project.
The definitions cover functionality that is considered useful to most ground control stations and autopilots.
MAVLink-compatible systems are expected to use these definitions where possible (if an appropriate message exists) rather than rolling out variants in their own [dialects](../messages/README.md).

The original definitions are defined in [common.xml](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/blob/master/message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml).

> **Tip** The common set `includes` [minimal.xml](minimal.md), which contains the *minimal set* of definitions for any MAVLink system.
  These definitions are [reproduced at the end of this topic](#minimal).
