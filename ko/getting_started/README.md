# Getting Started

Download or Generate MAVLink source files for your [dialect](../messages/README.md#dialects):

* **Download the [pre-built MAVLink source files](../README.md#prebuilt_libraries)** if you're working in a C/C++ project and using standard dialects.
* **Generate the MAVLink source files** to use any other [supported language](../README.md#supported_languages), add/modify messages or dialects, or use the example scripts: 
    1. [Install MAVLink](../getting_started/installation.md)
    2. [Generate Language-Specific Source Files](../getting_started/generate_libraries.md).

The following topics explain how to include the files in your project and use MAVLink:

* [Use the MAVLink Source Files](../getting_started/use_libraries.md) explains how to include the source files in your project and send messages.
* [Message Definitions](../messages/README.md) contains human-readable explanations of the messages.
* [Microservices](../services/README.md) explains the main sub-protocols for working with missions, cameras, images, parameters etc.
