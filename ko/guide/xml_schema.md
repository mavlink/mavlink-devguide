# MAVLink XML File Schema / Format

The format and structure of dialect files is formally defined in the XML Schema document: [mavschema.xsd](https://github.com/ArduPilot/pymavlink/blob/master/generator/mavschema.xsd).

While this is the canonical reference, it is easier to understand the XML file by example (as shown in the following sections).

## File Structure

The broad structure for MAVLink XML files is given below.

> **Note** If you're creating a custom dialect file your file structure should be similar to the one below (but may omit any/all sections).

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<mavlink>

    <include>common.xml</include>
    <include>other_dialect.xml</include>

    <!-- NOTE: If the included file already contains a version tag, remove the version tag here, else uncomment to enable. -->
    <!-- <version>6</version> -->

    <dialect>8</dialect>

    <enums>
        <!-- Enums are defined here (optional) -->
    </enums>

    <messages>
        <!-- Messages are defined here (optional) -->
    </messages>

</mavlink>
```

The main tags are listed below (all are optional):

- `include`: This tag is used to specify any other XML files included in your dialect. 
   - Typically dialect files will include *common.xml* as shown above.
   - You can include multiple files using separate tags.
   - The path to included files can be relative to your dialect file. Note however that the project tests only cover the case where dialects are in the same folder.
   - Nested `include` of files is not supported (only files specified in the top level `include` are imported).
   - When building, generator toolchains will merge/append enums in all files, and report duplicate enum entries and messages. 
- `version`: The minor version number for the release, as included in the [HEARTBEAT](../messages/common.md#HEARTBEAT message) `mavlink_version` field. 
   - For dialects that `include` **common.xml** the tag should be removed so that the `version` from **common.xml** is used (`version` from top level file will be used if specified).
   - For private dialects you can use whatever version you like. 

- `dialect`: This number is unique for your dialect. You should use: TBD <!-- how are these allocated -->

- [enums](#enum): Dialect-specific enums can be defined in this block (if none are defined in the file, the block is optional/can be removed).

- [messages](#messages): Dialect-specific messages can be defined in this block (if none are defined in the file, the block is optional/can be removed).

## Enum Definition (enums) {#enum}

Enums are used to define named values that may be used as options in messages - for example to define errors, states, or modes. There is also a special enum `MAV_CMD` that is used to define MAVLink commands.

Enums are defined within the `<enums> ... </enums>` blocks (as discussed in the previous section) using `<enum> ... </enum>` tags. Enum *values* are defined within the enum using `<entry> ... </entry>` tags.

For example, the definition of the [LANDING_TARGET_TYPE](../messages/common.md#LANDING_TARGET_TYPE) message is given below:

```xml
<enum name="LANDING_TARGET_TYPE">
    <description>Type of landing target</description>
    <entry value="0" name="LANDING_TARGET_TYPE_LIGHT_BEACON">
        <description>Landing target signaled by light beacon (ex: IR-LOCK)</description>
    </entry>
    <entry value="1" name="LANDING_TARGET_TYPE_RADIO_BEACON">
        <description>Landing target signaled by radio beacon (ex: ILS, NDB)</description>
    </entry>
    <entry value="2" name="LANDING_TARGET_TYPE_VISION_FIDUCIAL">
        <description>Landing target represented by a fiducial marker (ex: ARTag)</description>
    </entry>
    <entry value="3" name="LANDING_TARGET_TYPE_VISION_OTHER">
        <description>Landing target represented by a pre-defined visual shape/feature (ex: X-marker, H-marker, square)</description>
    </entry>
</enum>
```

The main `enum` tags/fields are:

- `name`: The name of the enum (mandatory). This is a string of capitalized, underscore-separated words.
- `description` (optional): A string describing the purpose of the enum
- `entry` (optional): An entry (zero or more entries can be specified for each enum)
- [deprecated](#deprecated) (optional): A tag indicating that the enum is deprecated.

> **Tip** [MAVLink Commands](#mav_cmd) are defined in the [MAV_CMD](../messages/common.md#mav_commands) enum.

### entry {#entry}

The "normal" enum `entry` tags/fields are:

- `name`: The name of the enum value (mandatory). This is a string of capitalized, underscore-separated words.
- `value` (optional): The *value* for the entry (a number).
- `description` (optional): A description of the entry.
- [deprecated](#deprecated) / [wip](#wip) (optional): A tag indicating that the enum is deprecated or "work in progress".

> **Note** An `entry` may also define the optional elements: `param`, `hasLocation`, and `isDestination`. In practice these should only be used in the `enum` named [MAV_CMD](#MAV_CMD) (described below).

## MAVLink Commands (enum MAV_CMD) {#MAV_CMD}

Individual `entry` values in the `enum` named [MAV_CMD](#MAV_CMD) are use to define *MAVLink Commands*. Each command has a `value` (its "command number") and specifies up to 7 parameters.

> **Note** These parameters are encoded in [MISSION_ITEM](../messages/common.md#MISSION_ITEM) or [MISSION_ITEM_INT](../messages/common.md#MISSION_ITEM_INT) messages ([Mission Protocol](../services/mission.md)), or [COMMAND_INT](../messages/common.md#COMMAND_INT) or [COMMAND_LONG](../messages/common.md#COMMAND_LONG) messages ([Command Protocol](../services/command.md)).

For example, see [MAV_CMD_NAV_PAYLOAD_PLACE](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_NAV_PAYLOAD_PLACE):

```xml
<enum name="MAV_CMD">
....
    <entry value="94" name="MAV_CMD_NAV_PAYLOAD_PLACE">
        <description>Descend and place payload. Vehicle descends until it detects a hanging payload has reached the ground, the gripper is opened to release the payload</description>
        <param index="1">Maximum distance to descend (meters)</param>
        <param index="2">Empty</param>
        <param index="3">Empty</param>
        <param index="4">Empty</param>
        <param index="5">Latitude (deg * 1E7)</param>
        <param index="6">Longitude (deg * 1E7)</param>
        <param index="7">Altitude (meters)</param>
</entry>
...
</enum>
```

MAV_CMD entry `value` elements may additionally define these tags/fields:

- [param](#param) (optional): Up to 7 param tags, numbered using an `index` attribute.
- One (but not both) of: 
   - `hasLocation` (optional): A boolean (default true) that provides a hint to a GCS that the entry should be displayed as a "standalone" location - rather than as a destination on the flight path. This is applied for entries that contain lat/lon/alt location information in their param 5, 6, and 7 values but which are not on the vehicle path (e.g.: [MAV_CMD_DO_SET_ROI_LOCATION](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_DO_SET_ROI_LOCATION)).
   - `isDestination` (optional): A boolean (default true) that provides a hint to a GCS that the entry is a location that should be displayed as a point on the flight path. This is applied for entries that contain lat/lon/alt location information in their param 5, 6, and 7 values and which are on the vehicle path (e.g.: [MAV_CMD_NAV_WAYPOINT](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_NAV_WAYPOINT) and [MAV_CMD_NAV_LAND](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_NAV_LAND)).

### param {#param}

The `<param>` tag is used in the [MAV_CMD](../messages/common.md#mav_commands) enum as part of defining mission commands. Each entry value may have up to 7 params declared, with `index` values from 1-7.

A `param` **must** include the following attribute:

- `index` - The parameter number (1 - 7).

A `param` **should** have:

- `description`: Parameter description string (tag body)

A `param` **should** also include the following optional attributes where appropriate (which may be used by a GUI for parameter display and editing):

- `label` - Display name to represent the parameter in a GCS or other UI. All words in label should be capitalised.
- `units` - SI units for the value.
- `enum` - Enum containing possible values for the parameter (if applicable).
- `decimalPlaces` - Hint to a UI about how many decimal places to use if the parameter value is displayed.
- `increment` - Allowed increments for the parameter value.
- `minValue` - Minimum value for param.
- `maxValue` - Maximum value for the param.
- `reserved` - Boolean indicating whether param is reserved for future use. If the attributes is not declared, then implicitly `reserved="False"`. > **Tip** See [Defining XML Enums/Messages > Reserved/Undefined Parameters](../guide/define_xml_element.md#reserved) for more information.
- `default` - Default value for the `param` (primarily used for `reserved` params, where the value is `0` or `NaN`).

## Message Definition (messages) {#messages}

Messages are defined within the `<messages> ... </messages>` block using `<message>...</message>` tags. Individual fields to be encoded in the message payload are defined using `<field> ... </field>` tags

For example,the definition of the [BATTERY_STATUS](../messages/common.md#BATTERY_STATUS) message is given below (this message was chosen because it contains many of the main fields and attributes.

```xml
    <message id="147" name="BATTERY_STATUS">
      <description>Battery information</description>
      <field type="uint8_t" name="id">Battery ID</field>
      <field type="uint8_t" name="battery_function" enum="MAV_BATTERY_FUNCTION">Function of the battery</field>
      <field type="uint8_t" name="type" enum="MAV_BATTERY_TYPE">Type (chemistry) of the battery</field>
      <field type="int16_t" name="temperature" units="cdegC">Temperature of the battery. INT16_MAX for unknown temperature.</field>
      <field type="uint16_t[10]" name="voltages" units="mV">Battery voltage of cells. Cells above the valid cell count for this battery should have the UINT16_MAX value.</field>
      <field type="int16_t" name="current_battery" units="cA">Battery current, -1: autopilot does not measure the current</field>
      <field type="int32_t" name="current_consumed" units="mAh">Consumed charge, -1: autopilot does not provide consumption estimate</field>
      <field type="int32_t" name="energy_consumed" units="hJ">Consumed energy, -1: autopilot does not provide energy consumption estimate</field>
      <field type="int8_t" name="battery_remaining" units="%">Remaining battery energy. Values: [0-100], -1: autopilot does not estimate the remaining battery.</field>
      <extensions/>
      <field type="int32_t" name="time_remaining" units="s">Remaining battery time, 0: autopilot does not provide remaining battery time estimate</field>
      <field type="uint8_t" name="charge_state" enum="MAV_BATTERY_CHARGE_STATE">State for extent of discharge, provided by autopilot for warning or external reactions</field>
    </message>
```

The main message tags/fields are:

- `message`: Each message is encapsulated by `message` tags, with the following attributes 
   - `id`: The id attribute is the unique index number of this message (in the example above: 147). 
      - For MAVLink 1:
      - Valid numbers range from 0 to 255.
      - The ids 0-149 and 230-255 are reserved for *common.xml*. Dialects can use 180-229 for custom messages (provided these are not used by other included dialects). 
      - For [MAVLink 2](../guide/mavlink_2.md):
      - Valid numbers range from 0 to 16777215.
      - All numbers below 255 should be considered reserved unless messages are also intended for MAVLink 1. > **Note** IDs are precious in MAVLink 1!
   - `name`: The name attribute provides a human readable form for the message (ie "BATTERY_STATUS"). It is used for naming helper functions in generated libraries, but is not sent over the wire.
- `description`: Human readable description of message, shown in user interfaces and in code comments. This should contain all information (and hyperlinks) to fully understand the message.
- `field`: Encodes one field of the message. The field value is its name/text string used in GUI documentation (but not sent over the wire). 
   - `type`: Similar to a field in a C `struct` - the size of the data required to store/represent the data type. 
      - Fields can be signed/unsigned integers of size 8, 16, 23, 64 bits (`{u)int8_t`, `(u)int16_t`, `(u)int32_t`, `(u)int64_t`), single/double precision IEEE754 floating point numbers. They can also be arrays of the other types - e.g. `uint16_t[10]`. 
   - `name`: Name of the field (used in code).
   - [enum](#enum) (optional): Name of an `enum` defining possible values of the field (e.g. `MAV_BATTERY_CHARGE_STATE`).
   - `units` (optional): The units for message `field`s that take numeric values (not enums). These are defined in the [schema](https://github.com/ArduPilot/pymavlink/blob/master/generator/mavschema.xsd) (search on *name="SI_Unit"*)
   - `display` (optional): This should be set as `display="bitmask"` for bitmask fields (hint to ground station that enum values must be displayed as checkboxes).
   - `print_format` (optional): TBD.
   - `default` (optional): TBD.
   - `instance`: If `true`, this indicates that the message contains the information for a particular sensor or battery (e.g. Battery 1, Battery 2, etc.) and that this field indicates which sensor. Default is `false`. > **Note** This field allows a recipient automatically associate messages for a particular sensor and plot them in the same series. 
- [deprecated](#deprecated) / [wip](#wip) (optional): A tag indicating that the message is deprecated or "work in progress".
- `extensions` (optional): This self-closing tag is used to indicate that subsequent fields apply to MAVLink 2 only. 
   - The tag should be used for MAVLink 1 messages only (id < 256) that have been extended in MAVLink 2. 

## Common Tags

This section lists a number of tags can be used in a number of other types - e.g. messages and enums.

### deprecated {#deprecated}

The `<deprecated>` tag can be used in an [enum](#enum), enum [entry](#entry) (value) or [message](#message) to indicate that the item has been superseded. The tag attributes indicates the time of deprecation and the replacement item, while the element may (optionally) contain a string with additional information about the deprecation.

The generator toolchain can be configured to conditionally build messages omitting the `deprecated` entries.

> **Tip** An entity should be marked as deprecated only when the main users have had an opportunity to update to the new method.

As a concrete example, below we see that [SET_MODE](../messages/common.md#SET_MODE) is deprecated and replaced by [MAV_CMD_DO_SET_MODE](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_DO_SET_MODE) on `2015-12`.

```xml
    <message id="11" name="SET_MODE">
      <deprecated since="2015-12" replaced_by="MAV_CMD_DO_SET_MODE">Use COMMAND_LONG with MAV_CMD_DO_SET_MODE instead</deprecated>
```

The `deprecated` attributes are:

- `since`: Year/month when deprecation started. Format: `YYYY-MM`.
- `replaced by`: String of entity that supersedes this item.

### wip {#wip}

The `<wip>` tag can be used in an enum [entry](#entry) (value) or [message](#message) to indicate that the item is a "work in progress". The element may (optionally) contain a string with additional information about the new item.

The generator toolchain can be configured to conditionally build messages omitting the `wip` entries.

Most commonly, the tag is used as shown:

```xml
<wip />
```
