# Dialect: MAVLINK Standard Message Set (standard.xml)

The MAVLink _standard_ message set contains _standard_ definitions that are managed by the MAVLink project.
The definitions are those that are expected to be implemented in all flight stacks/ground stations
AND are likely to be implemented in a compatible way.
The original definitions are defined in [standard.xml](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/blob/master/message_definitions/v1.0/standard.xml).
