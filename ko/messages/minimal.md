# MAVLink Minimal Set

The MAVLink *minimal* set contains the minimal set of definitions for a viable MAVLink system.

The message set is defined in [minimal.xml](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/blob/master/message_definitions/v1.0/minimal.xml) and is managed by the MAVLink project.

> **Tip** The minimal set is included (imported into) other xml definition files, including the [MAVLink Common Message Set (common.xml)](minimal.md).
