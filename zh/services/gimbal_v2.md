# Gimbal Protocol (v2)

:::info
This version supersedes [Gimbal Protocol v1](../services/gimbal.md)
Existing functionality is now fixed, but compatible changes may still be added.
:::

## 简介

The gimbal protocol allows MAVLink control over the attitude/orientation of cameras (or other sensors) mounted on the drone.
The orientation can be: controlled by the pilot in real time (e.g. using a joystick from a ground station), set as part of a mission, or moved based on camera tracking.

The protocol also defines what status information is published for developers, configurators, as well as users of the drone.
It additionally provides ways to assign control to different sources.

The protocol supports a number of hardware setups, and enables gimbals with varying capabilities.

:::info
The original protocol design document [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16pekKRXLN2FhlL9YNFP983cjfBKAsDwN0gOSks8USo4/edit?usp=sharing).

## Concepts

### Gimbal Manager and Gimbal Device

To accommodate gimbals with varying capabilities, and various hardware setups, "a gimbal" is conceptually split into two parts:

- **Gimbal Device:** the actual gimbal device, hardware and software.
- **Gimbal Manager:** software to deconflict gimbal messages and commands from different sources, and to abstract the capabilities of the **Gimbal Device** from gimbal users.

The _Gimbal Manager_ and _Gimbal Device_ expose respective _message sets_ that can be used for: gimbal manager/device discovery, querying capabilities, publishing status, and various types of orientation/attitude control.

The key concept to understand is that a _Gimbal Manager_ has a 1:1 relationship with a particular _Gimbal Device_, and is the only party on the MAVLink network that is allowed to directly command that device - it does so using the _Gimbal Device message set_.

:::info
The _Gimbal Device_ must act only upon messages that come from the associated _Gimbal Manager_!
The device will however _broadcast_ its status to all parties on the network (not just its manager).
:::

MAVLink applications (ground stations, developer APIs like the MAVSDK, etc.), and any other software that wants to control a particular gimbal, must do so via its _Gimbal Manager_, using the _Gimbal Manager message set_.

Note that the gimbal manager is (by default) implemented on the autopilot.

### Common Set-ups

This section outlines the three most common hardware set-ups.

#### Simple Gimbal Directly Connected to Autopilot

In this (default) set-up the autopilot takes the role of the gimbal manager.

#### Standalone Integrated Camera/Gimbal

In this set-up the integrated camera/gimbal itself can be the _Gimbal Manager_.

Therefore, the gimbal device interface is internal (no implementation is required).

#### Onboard Computer with Camera and Gimbal Connected to Autopilot

In this set-up the _Gimbal Manager_ can be on the onboard computer.

Commands from the GCS (etc.) are sent to the _Gimbal Manager_ on the companion computer.
Messages from the _Gimbal Manager_ to the _Gimbal Device_ need to be sent to/routed through the autopilot.

### Multiple Gimbals

Multiple gimbals per drone are supported.

#### Component IDs

Multiple component IDs are reserved for MAVLink gimbal devices: `MAV_COMP_ID_GIMBAL`, `MAV_COMP_ID_GIMBAL2`, `MAV_COMP_ID_GIMBAL3`, `MAV_COMP_ID_GIMBAL4`, `MAV_COMP_ID_GIMBAL5`, `MAV_COMP_ID_GIMBAL6`.

The listed component IDs should be used where possible.
Ids `0-6` may not be used.
Other ids may be used as long as the [MAV_TYPE](../messages/common.md#MAV_TYPE) is correctly set to [MAV_TYPE_GIMBAL](../messages/common.md#MAV_TYPE_GIMBAL).

#### Mapping from Gimbal Managers to Gimbal Devices

Every _Gimbal Manager_ has a single associated _Gimbal Device_ that it controls (there is a 1:1 relationship).
A particular MAVLink component, such as an autopilot, can implement multiple gimbal managers in order to control two or more gimbal devices.
The identity of a gimbal device and its associated manager, are represented by a "gimbal device id".
This id is used to differentiate messages from different gimbal managers, and also to target a particular gimbal in commands/messages sent to the component that is hosting its gimbal manager.

A _Gimbal Manager_ publishes the id of its associated device in the `gimbal_device_id` field of the [GIMBAL_MANAGER_INFORMATION](#GIMBAL_MANAGER_INFORMATION) message (this same field name is present in all gimbal manager messages so you can identify the source).
Similarly, commands that can be sent to a gimbal manager include a parameter with label `Gimbal device ID` that indicates the particular gimbal manager (and device).

- A system that wants to control a _particular_ gimbal device will send messages to the component that has the manager(s), such as an autopilot, specifying the device id of the gimbal to be controlled.
- A system that wants to control _all_ gimbal devices managed by gimbal managers on a particular component, would send the command/message to that component and set the device id to `0`.

#### Addressing of Gimbal MAVLink Devices {#gimbal_device_addressing}

For MAVLink gimbal devices the gimbal device id (`gimbal_device_id`) is the MAVLink [component ID of the gimbal device](#component-ids) controlled by the gimbal manager.

The gimbal manager processes commands for its associated device, sending appropriate/corresponding _gimbal device commands_ to the MAVLink gimbal device.

#### Addressing of non-MAVLink gimbal devices {#non_mavlink_gimbal_device_addressing}

Non-MAVLink gimbal devices are gimbals that don't expose a MAVLink Gimbal Device (or manager) API, but instead are connected to the gimbal manager using some other protocol.
For instance, this could be a PWM gimbal connected to an autopilot.
Since the gimbal device is not a MAVLink component, it does not have a unique MAVLink component ID that can be used for the gimbal device id.
Therefore you either have to make it into a MAVLink component (so it has an id) or assign it a particular non-MAVLink id.

Autopilots are expected to implement gimbal managers for each attached gimbal and assign each a unique gimbal device id between `1` and `6` (which is why these values can't be used as MAVLink component IDs for gimbal devices).
This id would then be used in gimbal manager messages sent by the autopilot, and for addressing the particular gimbal in commands.
The autopilot would directly control attached gimbals in response to gimbal manager commands.
In addition to sending _gimbal manager messages_ when appropriate, it should also send/stream required _gimbal device messages_, such as [GIMBAL_DEVICE_ATTITUDE_STATUS](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_ATTITUDE_STATUS).

All other hardware with attached gimbal devices, such as a companion computers, are expected to implement them as separate MAVLink components, with their own MAVLink component ID that can be used for addressing.
For example, a companion computer with an attached gimbal would appear as two MAVLink components: a companion computer and a gimbal.
The gimbal component would identify as a type `MAV_TYPE_GIMBAL` and assert that it implements the gimbal manager protocol.
As with autopilot-attached cameras it would need to respond as a gimbal manager, and also stream required gimbal device messages.

:::info
Implementing each attached camera as a separate MAVLink component allows cameras attached to a companion computer to be separately addressed in missions executed on the autopilot.
:::

## Implementation and Messages

### Messages between Ground Station and Gimbal Manager

#### Discovery of Gimbal Manager

A ground station should monitor for `HEARTBEAT` messages from all new components and check their capabilities by requesting [AUTOPILOT_VERSION](../messages/common.md#AUTOPILOT_VERSION) for autopilots and [COMPONENT_INFORMATION_BASIC](../messages/common.md#COMPONENT_INFORMATION_BASIC) for other components (see [HEARTBEAT/Connection protocol](../services/heartbeat.md)).

If the `capabilities` field of the above message(s) has the flag [MAV_PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY_COMPONENT_IMPLEMENTS_GIMBAL_MANAGER](../messages/common.md#MAV_PROTOCOL_CAPABILITY_COMPONENT_IMPLEMENTS_GIMBAL_MANAGER) set:

- GCS should send a [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE](#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE) to the component for [GIMBAL_MANAGER_INFORMATION](#GIMBAL_MANAGER_INFORMATION).
- Component should respond by emitting a `GIMBAL_MANAGER_INFORMATION` message for each gimbal manager that it implements.

The `GIMBAL_MANAGER_INFORMATION` contains important information a particular gimbal, such as its capabilities ([GIMBAL_MANAGER_CAP_FLAGS](#GIMBAL_MANAGER_CAP_FLAGS)), maximum angles and angle rates, as well as the `gimbal_device_id` which identifies the specific gimbal device controlled by a particular _Gimbal Manager_.

:::warning
A GCS should always request `GIMBAL_MANAGER_INFORMATION` from autopilot components prior to: PX4 v1.16, ArduPilot-4.5 (when the protocol bit was added).
:::

#### Gimbal Manager Status

A _Gimbal Manager_ should send out [GIMBAL_MANAGER_STATUS](#GIMBAL_MANAGER_STATUS) at a low regular rate (e.g. 5 Hz) to inform the ground station about its status.

### Starting / Configuring Gimbal Control

It is possible for multiple components to want to control a gimbal at the same time, e.g.: a ground station, a companion computer, or the autopilot running a mission.

In order to start controlling a gimbal, a component first needs to send the [MAV_CMD_DO_GIMBAL_MANAGER_CONFIGURE](#MAV_CMD_DO_GIMBAL_MANAGER_CONFIGURE) command.
This allows setting which MAVLink component (set by system ID and component ID) is in primary control and which one is in secondary control.
The gimbal manager is to ignore any gimbal controls which come from MAVLink components that are not explicity set to "in control".
This should prevent conflicts between various inputs as long as all components are fair/co-operative when using the configure command.

To be co-operative entails the following rules:

- Don't send the configure manager configure command continuously but only once to initiate and once to stop control again.
- Check the [GIMBAL_MANAGER_STATUS](#GIMBAL_MANAGER_STATUS) about who is in control first and - if possible - warn user about planned action. For example, if the autopilot is in control of the gimbal as part of a mission, the ground station should ask the user first (i.e. via a pop-up) if they really want to take over manual control.
- Don't forget to release control when an action/task is finished and set the sysid/compid to 0.

:::info
It is possible to assign control to another component too, not just to itself.
For example, a smart shot running on a companion computer can set itself to be in primary control but assign a ground station for secondary control to e.g. nudge during the smart shot.
:::

:::info
The implementation of how primary and secondary control are combined or mixed is not defined by the protocol but up to the implementation.
This allows flexibility for different use cases.
:::

#### Manual Gimbal Control using MAVLink

A ground station can manually control a gimbal by sending [GIMBAL_MANAGER_SET_MANUAL_CONTROL](#GIMBAL_MANAGER_SET_MANUAL_CONTROL).
This allows controlling the gimbal with either angles, or angular rates, using a normalized unit (-1..1).
The gimbal device is responsible for translating the input based on angle, speed, and "smoothness" settings.

This input can additionally be scaled by the gimbal manager depending on its state. For example, if the gimbal manager is on a camera and knows the current zoom level / focal length of the camera, it can scale the angular rate down to support smooth paning and tilting.

#### Controlling Gimbal Angle and/or Angular Rate using MAVLink

A ground station, companion computer, or other MAVLink component can set the gimbal angle and/or angular rates using the messages [GIMBAL_MANAGER_SET_ATTITUDE](#GIMBAL_MANAGER_SET_ATTITUDE) or [GIMBAL_MANAGER_SET_PITCHYAW](#GIMBAL_MANAGER_SET_PITCHYAW).

### Messages between Gimbal Manager and Gimbal Device

#### Discovery of Gimbal Device

The MAVlink node where the _Gimbal Manager_ is implemented needs to discover _Gimbal Devices_ by sending a broadcast [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE](#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE_2) for [GIMBAL_DEVICE_INFORMATION](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_INFORMATION).
Every gimbal device should respond with `GIMBAL_DEVICE_INFORMATION`.

The MAVLink node should then create as many _Gimbal Manager_ instances as _Gimbal Devices_ found.

#### Control of a Gimbal Device

To control the angle and/or angular rate of the _Gimbal Device_, use the message [GIMBAL_DEVICE_SET_ATTITUDE](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_SET_ATTITUDE).
If the gimbal manager has multiple gimbal control inputs available it should deconflict them as explained below.

#### Autopilot State for Gimbal Device

The autopilot should also send the message [AUTOPILOT_STATE_FOR_GIMBAL_DEVICE](#AUTOPILOT_STATE_FOR_GIMBAL_DEVICE) to the gimbal device.
This data is required by the _Gimbal Device_ attitude estimator (horizon compensation), as well as to anticipate the vehicle's movements (e.g. the feed forward angular velocity in z-axis, so the current yaw intention).

### Gimbal Device Broadcast/Status Messages

The gimbal device should send out its attitude and status in [GIMBAL_DEVICE_ATTITUDE_STATUS](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_ATTITUDE_STATUS) at a regular rate, e.g. 10 Hz.

This message is a meant as broadcast, so it's set to the GCS, _Gimbal Manager_, and all parties on the network (not just _Gimbal Manager_, like all other messages).

### Custom Gimbal Device Settings

Custom gimbal settings can be accomplished using the component information microservice which is based on a [component information file](../services/component_information.md) (this is similar to the [camera definition file](../services/camera_def.md)).

## FAQ

#### How to set the System ID of a gimbal device?

The system ID of all components (e.g. autopilot, companion computer, camera, gimbal) on a drone/system must be the same.
This needs to be either done manually by configuration, or alternatively, the components need to listen to the heartbeat of the autopilot and then adjust their system ID accordingly.

#### When is Gimbal Device also a Gimbal Manager?

The default case should be to use the _Gimbal Manager_ in the autopilot.
The only exception to this are integrated solutions containing a camera and gimbal for functionality like visual tracking.

#### How to test Gimbal Device?

A _Gimbal Device_ can be tested by connecting it to an autopilot with a _Gimbal Manager_.
To avoid having to do a full setup including autopilot, a [direct test using MAVSDK](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/tree/develop/examples/gimbal_device_tester) is available.

#### How to control a gimbal with the old MAVLink protocol?

Gimbals that use the (old) [Gimbal Protocol v1](../services/gimbal.md) should still be supported by autopilot software.
Basically, the _Gimbal Manager_ needs to translate the commands to the old protocol.

#### How to control a gimbal without MAVLink support?

Gimbals controlled using a protocol like PPM, PWM, SBUS or something proprietary can still be supported.
The autopilot will have to act as the _Gimbal Manager_ and provide the driver and translation to the respective protocol.

#### What about RC (non-MAVLink) control?

The autopilot needs to be configured to either accept MAVLink input (so [GIMBAL_MANAGER_SET_MANUAL_CONTROL](#GIMBAL_MANAGER_SET_MANUAL_CONTROL)) or RC control.
In both cases, the autopilot can then calculate a gimbal angle or angular rate from the manual control input and send the resulting setpoint to the gimbal device.

For RC control, the channels will have to be manually mapped/configured to control the gimbal.
This is the same approach as is used for managing the input source for flying; it is up to the implementation to select either RC or MAVLink.
The recommendation is to make it configurable using (for instance) a parameter.

#### Non-MAVLink gimbals

A non-MAVLink gimbal needs to be connected to a gimbal manager, which then takes care of sending the gimbal device messages.
Since a non-MAVLink gimbal can't be addressed with a MAVLink component ID, the `gimbal_device_id` needs to be set to one of the magic values (1 to 6).
This signals that the gimbal manager also is also acting as the gimbal device.

Also see [how to address non-MAVLink gimbal devices](#non_mavlink_gimbal_device_addressing).

#### How to interpret `GIMBAL_DEVICE_ATTITUDE_STATUS` yaw gimbal angle

The [GIMBAL_DEVICE_ATTITUDE_STATUS.flags](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_ATTITUDE_STATUS) field must report the frame used for reported yaw values as **either**:

- `GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_VEHICLE_FRAME`: Yaw is relative to vehicle.
- `GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_EARTH_FRAME`: Yaw is relative to north.

For older devices, if neither of the flags above are set, the yaw frame must be inferred from the `GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_LOCK`.
If it is set, the yaw is relative to North, otherwise to the front of the vehicle.

:::info
Manufacturers working on new gimbal devices should set either `GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_VEHICLE_FRAME` or `GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_IN_EARTH_FRAME`.
Components receiving the message should also handle `GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS_YAW_LOCK` for backwards compatibility with older devices.

In this case the gimbal manager is implemented by the autopilot which "sends" the attitude command (for instance for a survey).

## How to Implement the Gimbal Device Interface

Below is a short summary of all messages that a gimbal device should implement.

:::info
A _Gimbal Device_ can be tested by connecting it to an autopilot with a _Gimbal Manager_.
To avoid having to do a full setup including autopilot, a [direct test using MAVSDK](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK/tree/develop/examples/gimbal_device_tester) is available.
:::

### Messages to Send

The messages listed should be broadcast on the network/on all connections (sent to everyone).

#### [HEARTBEAT](../messages/common.md#HEARTBEAT)

Heartbeats should always be sent (usually at 1 Hz).

:::info
Gimbals that set their `sysid` from the autopilot will need to wait for the autopilot's heartbeat before emitting their own (note that if the gimbal can receive heartbeats from multiple autopilots then the `sysid` must be explicitly/statically configured).
:::

- `sysid`: the same sysid as the autopilot (this can either be done by configuration, or by listening to the autopilot's heartbeat first and then copying the sysid, default: 1)
- `compid`: [MAV_COMP_ID_GIMBAL](../messages/common.md#MAV_COMP_ID_GIMBAL)
- `type`: [MAV_TYPE_GIMBAL](../messages/common.md#MAV_TYPE_GIMBAL)
- `autopilot`: [MAV_AUTOPILOT_INVALID](../messages/common.md#MAV_AUTOPILOT_INVALID)
- `base_mode`: 0
- `custom_mode`: 0
- `system_status`: `MAV_STATE_UNINIT`

#### [GIMBAL_DEVICE_ATTITUDE_STATUS](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_ATTITUDE_STATUS)

The gimbal device should send out its attitude status at a regular rate, e.g. 10 Hz.
The fields `target_system` and `target_component` can be set to 0 (broadcast) by default.

#### [GIMBAL_DEVICE_INFORMATION](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_INFORMATION)

The static information about the gimbal device needs to be sent out when requested using [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE).

### Messages to Listen To/Handle

#### [GIMBAL_DEVICE_SET_ATTITUDE](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_SET_ATTITUDE)

This is the actual attitude setpoint that the gimbal device should follow.
Note that the frame of the quaternion setpoint depends on the [GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_FLAGS).

#### [AUTOPILOT_STATE_FOR_GIMBAL_DEVICE](#AUTOPILOT_STATE_FOR_GIMBAL_DEVICE)

The gimbal device should be able to get all the information from the autopilot that it requires in this one message.
If something is missing that should be streamed at a high rate, it should be added to this message.

If this message is not sent by default by the autopilot, or the rate is not ok, the command [MAV_CMD_SET_MESSAGE_INTERVAL](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_SET_MESSAGE_INTERVAL) can be used to request it at a certain rate.

#### [COMMAND_LONG](../messages/common.md#COMMAND_LONG)

The gimbal device needs to check for commands. See below which commands should get answered.

### Commands to Answer

#### [MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE)

The gimbal device should send out messages when they get requested, e.g. [GIMBAL_DEVICE_INFORMATION](#GIMBAL_DEVICE_INFORMATION).

#### [MAV_CMD_SET_MESSAGE_INTERVAL](../messages/common.md#MAV_CMD_SET_MESSAGE_INTERVAL)

The gimbal device should stream messages at the rate requested.
