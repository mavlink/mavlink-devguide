# MAVLINK通用消息集

The MAVLink *common* message set is defined in [common.xml](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/blob/master/message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml). It contains the *standard* definitions that are managed by the MAVLink project.

The definitions cover functionality that is considered useful to most ground control stations and autopilots. MAVLink-compatible systems are expected to use these definitions where possible (if an appropriate message exists) rather than rolling out variants in their own [dialects](../messages/README.md).

This topic is a human-readable form of [common.xml](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/blob/master/message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml).
