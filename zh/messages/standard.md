# Dialect: MAVLINK Standard Message Set (standard.xml)

The MAVLink *standard* message set contains *standard* definitions that are managed by the MAVLink project. The definitions are those that are expected to be implemented in all flight stacks/ground stations AND are likely to be implemented in a compatible way. This is a human-readable form of the XML definition file: [standard](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink/blob/master/message_definitions/v1.0/standard).
