# Routing

MAVLink 2.0 has a source system and component ID as well as a destination system and component ID. While the source IDs are part of every message, destination IDs are only assigned for cases where a destination ID is required.



## Router Implementation

The [MAVLink Router](https://github.com/01org/mavlink-router) created by Intel allows to mix-and-match different IP protocols with serial ports and route MAVLink traffic.
